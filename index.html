                When it comes to reliability, the new machines of Samsung is far more reliable than those early machines
                they circulated in the market. Samsungâ€™s new machines are pretty reliable and can compete with other
                brands.

                But when it comes to price and specs ratio, you can probably find a better buy with another brand.

                The AT is IBM PC compatible, with the most significant difference being a move to the 80286 processor
                from the 8088 processor of prior models. Like the IBM PC, the AT supported an optional math co-processor
                chip, the Intel 80287, for faster execution of floating point operations.

                In addition, it introduces the AT bus, later known as the ISA bus, a 16-bit bus with backwards
                compatibility with 8-bit PC-compatible expansion cards. The bus also offered fifteen IRQs and seven DMA
                channels, expanded from eight IRQs and four DMA channels for the PC, achieved by adding another 8259A
                IRQ controller and another 8237A DMA controller.[5][6] Some IRQ and DMA channels are used by the
                motherboard and not exposed on the expansion bus. Both dual IRQ and DMA chipsets are cascading which
                shares the primary pair. In addition to these chipsets, Intel 82284 Clock Driver and Ready Interface and

                What if OPPO brought the F19 with not only 5X but 10X Optical Zoom? An innovative brand like this can do
                anything and we already know that this brand has already achieved impossible and now OPPO F19 is going

                its back camera lens. Not only that OPPO's F19 is also speculated to get the 3D picture in which you can
                change your outfits and you can also do different things with the same type of camera that used in other
                devices. from OPPO have focused on the camera section of the F19 and now you will get a smarter camera
                capable to zoom just like a DSLR camera lens and all this is going to happen with distortion of the
                pixels of the images. OPPO F19's camera will be so powerful that it can also capture photos in the night
                without using the flashlight which from Samsung has used in its flagship smartphone and now OPPO
